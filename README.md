# Bengaluru-House-Price-Regression-Project
End-to-end Machine Learning regression project to predict Bengaluru house prices using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest with MAE, RMSE, and R² evaluation metrics.

Project Overview
- Built a machine learning regression model to predict Bengaluru house prices.
- Used property features such as location, total square feet, BHK, bathrooms, and other attributes.
- Objective was to develop a reliable price prediction model using real estate data.

Workflow
- Performed data cleaning and handled missing values.
- Removed outliers and corrected inconsistent entries.
- Applied feature engineering and encoding techniques.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained and evaluated multiple regression models.

Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Result
- Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance.
- Selected as the final model for house price prediction.
